    The array elements are in form *option* => *value*.

    To retrieve all possible option names, consider the names of all the
    methods in this class which begin with "set" (excluding this one) with
    \c set- prefix cut and then first letter lowercased. And option values
    will be values passed to those methods. For example: method `setTree()` 
    &mdash;> option `tree`.

    \param array $options options
    \return $this
