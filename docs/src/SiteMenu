    tree node and container. To become global menu container (root node) 
    when loading menu tree by loadMenu() function, an instance must have id
    (see **Zend_Navigation_Page::setId()**) set to **null** (it is the default
    sinse it's done by this class constructor).

    with instance of class ZfBlank_DbTable_SiteMenu or its descendants.

    `setTitle()`. The methods to set or get the hyperlink of menu item:
    `getUri()` and `setUri()`. The item id can be accessed by `getId()` and
    `setId()`. These methods come from parent class and they are used in load
    and save procedures.
