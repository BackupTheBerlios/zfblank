    \ingroup grp_root

 *  To inquire about 'fields' and 'field names' see
    \ref datamap "Data Map". A common usage of this class is
    as following:
    - bind to a row object and set field name by calling corresponding methods
    or setting (\ref __construct() "constructor") options;
    - set miscellaneous decoration parameters by calling corresponding methods
    or setting (\ref __construct() "constructor") options;
    - retrieve the result by calling decorate() method.

    Another way of use is to extend this class and preset some options
    in protected variables, which is set by default to **null** here.

    \see ZfBlank_ActiveRow_Abstract::fieldDecorator()
    \todo More decoration features (substring replacement, regex replacement,
    ...)
