    \ingroup grp_pagecontent

    Default row class is ZfBlank_PageContent.

    This table class works with row class ZfBlank_PageContent and database table
    containing named static content blocks.
    Every block has unique string identifier (instead of auto-assigned
    integer) that is more convenient to be used as a part of URL pointing
    the page (when the block represents entire page, such as homepage, 'about'
    page, etc.), or distinguish the block in admin zone. Block content may be
    stored either in database or in file.

    The sample database table schema (in MySql notation):

    \include zfb.pagecontent.sql

    When text is stored in file instead of database, path to text files
    is determined by \ref $_textPath property (see also setTextPath()). Name
    of the file is equal to content block name (i.e. primary key).
