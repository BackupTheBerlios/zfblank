    \ingroup grp_article
    
    Default row class is ZfBlank_Article.

    This table class adds (optional) support of relation with a users table for
    article authors. By default, the author simply is indicated by a string with
    his/her
    name. When \ref $_usersTable property is not **null** (as it can be set
    in a subclass), getUsersTable()
    method will return table object for users table and
    ZfBlank_Article::authorName() will return name taken from that table.

    Recommended DB schema (in MySql notation):

    \include zfb.articles.sql

    \see ZfBlank_DbTable_Users
