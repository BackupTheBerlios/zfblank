    Either $value parameter must be passed or row and field name must be
    set (see setRow() and setFieldName()), otherwise exception will be thrown.

    \param string $value value to decorate (optional)
    \remark The parameter was introduced to avoid infinite recursion when
    this method is called from ZfBlank_ActiveRow_Abstract::__call().
    Nevertheless, it can be used at will, in other cases.
    \return string: decorated value
