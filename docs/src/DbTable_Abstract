    \ingroup grp_root

    This class is designed to work in connection with
    ZfBlank_ActiveRow_Abstract class descendants in the role of it's row class.
    With this sort of collaboration
    it provides (in addition to the functionality inherited from
    `Zend_Db_Table_Abstract`) find and count methods for every 
    ref datamap "field" in data model.

    Default row class is set to ZfBlank_ActiveRow.

    ### Find and Count Methods ###

    This class provides "find" and "count" method calls
    for every field in associated row class (that extends
    ZfBlank_ActiveRow_Abstract). Find and count methods act like proxies to
    findFor() and countFor() methods respectively. Their definitions are as
    follows:

        findFor<Field>($value)
        countFor<Field>($value)

    with field name's first letter uppercased.

    For example, the find method for a field named `"address"` is
    `findForAddress($value)`. And this method call will be transformed to
    `findFor('address', $value)`, whose result will be returned.
