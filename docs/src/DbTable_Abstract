    \ingroup grp_root

    This class is designed to work in connection with
    ZfBlank_ActiveRow_Abstract class descendants in the role of it's row class.
    With this sort of collaboration
    it provides (in addition to the functionality inherited from
    `Zend_Db_Table_Abstract`) find methods for every \ref datamap "field"
    in data model.

    ### Find Methods ###

    This class provides "find" method calls
    for every field name in associated row class. Row class should extend 
    ZfBlank_ActiveRow_Abstract. Find methods act like proxies to
    findFor() method. The find method definition is as follows:

        findFor<Field>($value)

    Note that field name is uppercased. For example, for field `"name"`,
    the method will be `findForName($value)`. And this method call 
    will be transformed to `findFor('name', $value)`, and the result of
    findFor() will be returned.
