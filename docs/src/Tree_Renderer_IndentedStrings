    \ingroup grp_tree

    This renderer converts a tree to an array of indented strings. Strings
    are taken from one particular data field in each node (default field is
    'name'). Indents can be added on left, right, or both sides of a string.
    Number of indents corresponds the node's depth in tree. Root (or toplevel)
    nodes make no indent. The default indent is tab symbol (\c "\t") but
    it can be set to any symbol or string.

    By default, the keys of resulting array are the same as the nodes' ID's.
    Use \ref setIdKeys() "setIdKeys(\c false)" to have plain incremental keys.
