    \ingroup grp_tree

    This renderer maps tree of type ZfBlank_Tree to plain text with special
    markup designating beginning and end of items that represent tree nodes
    and containers. Containers are of two types: global (or root) container 
    and children containers. Global container's begin and end markers
    are placed around entire text. Children container's begin and end markers
    are placed around items that represent child nodes. And item's begin
    and end markers are placed around item text and children container (if
    an item has chilren). Here is exemplary schematic layout:

    \verbatim
    ROOT_CONTAINER_BEGIN
        ITEM_BEGIN
            1st item text
            CONTAINER_BEGIN
                ITEM_BEGIN
                    1st item 1st child text
                ITEM_END
                ITEM_BEGIN
                    1st item 2nd child text
                    CONTAINER BEGIN
                        ITEM_BEGIN
                            1st item 2nd child 1st child text
                        ITEM_END
                        
                        ...

                    CONTAINER_END
                ITEM_END
                
                ...

            CONTAINER_END
        ITEM_END
        ITEM_BEGIN
            2nd item text
        ITEM_END

        ...

    ROOT_CONTAINER_END
    \endverbatim

    Note that the renderer doesn't produce neither indents nor linebreaks.
    You must insert newlines (`\n`) by hand into markup strings if you need
    ones. To clarify the purpose of this renderer, consider that it may be
    used, for instance, to produce multi-level HTML lists. For that, set 
    container begin marker to `<ul>`, container end marker to `</ul>`,
    and item markers to `<li>` and `</li>`. If the root container markers
    are not set (i.e. are **null**), they are copied from corresponding
    children container markers.

    The text for every item is copied from the value of particular data field
    of corresponding tree node. You can set the name of this field. By default
    it is 'name' (so the value is received by getName() node method).
 
    A pattern can be used in item or children container begin markers, that
    will be substituted by current node's ID (retrieved by node's getId()
    method or iterator's key() method).
    By default, the pattern is `%%`, but it can be changed. For example: 
    item begin marker `<li id="node-%%">` for node with ID=123 will be
    rendered as `<li id="node-123">`
