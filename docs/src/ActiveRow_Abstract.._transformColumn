    The parent method overloaded, providing column name transformation
    by using \ref datamap "data map" array.
    \note Overloading this method may break overall class logic, so it's 
    not recommended. To change the way column names are transformed to field
    names, if you didn't defined the 
    transformation manually in \ref datamap "data map" &mdash; overload
    _dataMapTransform() method instead.
    \param string $columnName physical DB column name
    \see datamap "Data Map"
    \see _dataMapTransform()
    \return string: object property (field) name
