    \ingroup grp_comment

    Default row class is ZfBlank_Comment.

    This table class adds (optional) support of relation with a users table for
    comments authors. By default, the author is simply indicated by a string
    with his/her
    name. When \ref $_usersTable property is not **null** (as it can be set
    in a subclass), getUsersTable()
    method will return table object for users table and
    ZfBlank_Comment::authorName() will return name taken from that table.

    Reference physical table schema (in MySql notation):

    \include zfb.comments.sql

    \see ZfBlank_DbTable_Users
