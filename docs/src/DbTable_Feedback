    \ingroup grp_feedback

    Default row class is ZfBlank_Feedback.

    This class adds (optional) support of relation with a users table for
    comment authors. By default, the author is simply indicated by a string with
    his/her
    name. When \ref $_usersTable property is not **null** (as it can be set
    in a subclass), getUsersTable()
    method will return table object for users table and
    ZfBlank_Feedback::authorName() will return name taken from that table.

    Sample database table schema (in MySql notation):

    \include zfb.feedback.sql

    \see ZfBlank_DbTable_Users
