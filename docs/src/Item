    ### Data Map ###

    Note that though all _column_ names (values of array) can be varied freely,
    some _field_ names are referenced in this and another classes methods so
    renaming or removal of them will result in broken functionality.
    Their data types and purpose must be kept as well. 
    _parent_ and _offset_ fields may be abandoned if items are not organized
    in tree structure. _category_ field may be abandoned if items are not
    categorized. _id_ field is mandatory unconditionally.

    Field Name  | Column Name       |Type                | Required | Description
    ----------  | ----------------- |------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------
    \a id       | \c ID             |arbitrary           | +        | unique tree node ID
    \a parent   | \c ParentID       |the same as of *id* | +/&ndash;| ID of tree node parent
    \a offset   | \c ChildOffset    |integer             | +/&ndash;| position among sibling nodes (0 = first)
    \a category | \c categoryID     |arbitrary           | +/&ndash;| category ID (foreign key)

    Fields _parent_ and _offset_ are required by inherited ZfBlank_Tree methods.
    They can be abandoned if items are not organized hierarchically.

    Methods requiring _category_ field: categoryName(), categorySetByName().
