    \ingroup grp_tree

    This iterator can be used to simply walk through entire tree straight from
    root node to very last leaf node. Each step it sets two parameters, one of
    which holds current depth of node inside the tree, and other indicates
    difference between previous and current depths. Children are passed from
    first to last.

    This iterator implements PHP **Iterator** interface.

    \note If an iterator has been taken from "empty" root node (see
    ZfBlank_Tree) and you use this iterator in **foreach** loop: see
    rewindPoint() on how to exclude root node from iteration set.
