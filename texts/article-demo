<h2>Articles, Comments, Categories and Tags</h2>
<p>
See
<a href="/news">News</a>
for a demonstration of categorizable and taggable articles that can be commented.
News are made from
<a href="/docs/group__grp__feed.html">Feed</a>
module that supplements
<a href="/docs/group__grp__article.html">articles</a>
mainly with ability to generate short descriptions from article body.
</p>
<p>
Comments can also comment one another thus forming a "comment tree".
But it's not implemented in News yet, as it requires additional browser-side work.
Also, if user registration is on the site, articles, comments and feedback are able to cooperate with user accounts.
