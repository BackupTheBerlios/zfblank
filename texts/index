<p>ZF_Blanks is a model-space library that works in Zend Framework environment.
It presents a number of models commonly used in website development, such as
user account with registration and login functionality, user feedback and comments, articles, FAQs, menus, and others,
and also some generalizations, such as trees. Though models diversity is
limited, they are based on 
abstractions that make them (and the package as a whole) rather flexible and
extendable, sometimes without extending classes. Some models go with view
helpers and other auxiliaries.</p>
<p>This site itself is the example application for ZF_Blanks library.
It uses the library in all its sections (not only those under the Demos menu).
The exception
is the Documentation section which is static HTML generated by the
<a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> system.
The site also has an admin module.
You can see it in work if you install example application packaged together with
the library on your server.

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>Initial motivation to write this library was a desire to have some solid
ZF-based website development basis that allows:
    <ul>
        <li>to speed up the development of common website parts, getting
        more time to concentrate on non-trivial stuff;</li>
        <li>at the same time, to get rid of copying logic from projects made
        previously and adapting it to current requirements.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
